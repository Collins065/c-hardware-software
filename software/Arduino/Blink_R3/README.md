# Blink_R3

Simple Arduino blink example.

## Files
- `Blink_R3.ino` — Arduino sketch. Blink an LED (board built-in LED or external).

## How to run
1. Open `Blink_R3.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select your board (e.g., Arduino Uno) and the correct COM/serial port.
3. Click Upload.

## Wiring (if using external LED)
- LED + (long leg) -> 220Ω resistor -> Digital 13 (or the pin used in the sketch)
- LED − (short leg) -> GND

## Notes
This demonstrates basic microcontroller familiarity and clean repository structure. Add a wiring photo to `hardware/schematics/` if you want to show physical setup.
